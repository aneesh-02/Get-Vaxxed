The Wesite is live at [GetVaxxed](https://aneesh-02.github.io/Get-Vaxxed/)


### Project Description
This application is designed to help users book Covid-19 vaccine appointments. The application includes several pages, including a login page, sign up page, home page, location page, date page, personal details page, confirmation page, 2nd dose page, and edit/view appointments page. The pages are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly.
<br>
The login page is the first page that users will see when they navigate to the website. Users will need to enter their credentials, which are validated before they can log in. If they don't have an account, they can navigate to the sign up page to create one.
<br>
Once they are logged in, users can navigate to the home page, where they will see quick links to each page in the form of breadcrumbs. From there, they can proceed to the location page, where they can either use their device location or search manually to find nearby vaccination centers.
<br>
Next, users can select a date for their appointment on the date page. If no time slot is available, they will be notified with an alert. If a time slot is available, they can proceed to the personal details page, where they will need to fill out a form.
<br>
Once their details are saved in the backend database, they can view their appointment details on the confirmation page. They will also receive an email and SMS with the appointment details.
<br>
If the user needs to book a second dose, they can navigate to the 2nd dose page, where they will be prompted to enter their name and the date of their first dose. They will receive a suggested date for their second dose.
<br>
Finally, users can view and edit their appointments on the edit/view appointments page.
